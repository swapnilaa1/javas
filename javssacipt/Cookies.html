    <!--   we can see the cookies are added at the domain address name..
    max-age means the duration for which the cookies will remain till date..-->
    <!--
            <script>
        document.cookie="username:users5 ;max-age:"+60*60*10+"; path=/";
                 document.cookie="username:users8; expires:Fri, 30-Sep-2022 10:00:00 UTC";
    
    </script>


    for deleting any cookies 
    we have to set expires attribute as old date...
    to then the cookies get distroyed...

    cookies have path security etc....

    how to append any cookies 
    if we have created a cookies  again we create a cookies with the same name then old cookies get
    overrittem by new cookies...
    else if we create a cookies with new name then the old cookie gets appeneded by new cookies...


    how to read cookies ..
    all the cookies we make that comes together as a string ... 
    then we can split them on the basis of ; 
    so we get array of each key pair...
    again we can split the array element in key value pair and we can get them 
    
        cookies data ?
        when we send a request to server then the request with our data is stored in 
        cookies at client side..
        so whenever we again make request the cookies data is passed to server..
        so this has some pro and cons in it ...
        so there comes a problem of sequrity...

    <!--   Local storage...
    local storage data gets stored in browser unless we delete it ...
    so whenever we want to get the data from local storage.. it is always available to us
    unless it is deleted..
    local and session storage data is not passed to server...


    <script>
    window.localStorage.setItem('name' ,"swapnil" );
    window.localStorage.setItem('your_name' ,"sushant" );
    console.log(window.localStorage.getItem('name'));
    console.log(window.localStorage.key(1));
    console.log(localStorage.removeItem('name'));
    localStorage.clear();
    
    </script>
    -->


    <!--
        session storage data is permanent data , when we close the browser window the session data gets deleted
        and even if we change the tab the session data gets deleted..
